oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
To the dharmakāya Amitābha we pray!
To the saṃbhogakāya—the Great Compassionate One—we pray!
To the nirmāṇakāya Padmākara we pray!
Wondrous emanation, master of mine,
In India, you were born, you studied and you contemplated;
To the heart of Tibet you came, to subjugate its arrogant demons,
In Orgyen you dwell, accomplishing the benefit of beings:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When we gaze on the wonder of your perfect form,
Your right hand forms the mudrā of the sword,
Your left in the mudrā of summoning.
Your mouth held open, with teeth bared, you gaze up into the sky.
O Gyalwé Dungdzin, Protector of Beings:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When hearing the priceless teachings of Dharma,
Your body shines with a dazzling radiance of light,
In your right hand, volumes of the tripiṭaka,
In your left, the texts of Kīlaya.
All these profound teachings have infused your mind,
O Paṇḍita of Yangleshö:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When placing under oath the protectors who abide by their vows
In that supreme place of power, immaculate and enchanting,
On the very border of India and Tibet, 2
You grant your blessing, and as soon as you arrive
The mountain becomes fragrant, a sweet scent wafting through the air,
Even in winter lotus flowers bloom,
And there flows a spring called 'Nectar of Enlightenment'.
In this supreme and sacred place, inundated with bliss,
O Kyéchok Tsul Zang, clad in Dharma robes,
Your right hand wielding a nine-spoked vajra,
Your left holding a jewelled casket
Brimful of the elixir of rakta.
You bind under oath the ḍākinīs and guardians who keep their pledges,
And you attain the siddhi of beholding the yidam deity face to face:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When you establish the teaching of the buddhas,
And practise in the Slate Mountain forest,
Your ‘kīla of approach’ soars into the wide open sky.
You catch it with the vajra mudrā, roll it
Between your hands and hurl it into the Sandalwood Forest,
Which bursts into flames, evaporating its lake.
In an instant, you burn the land of the tīrthikas to ashes,
And crush their dark yakṣa lords into dust.
O peerless Dükyi Shéchen:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When overpowering the rākṣasas,
You appear as a youth in nirmāṇakāya garb,
Your amazing, beautiful form, with its lovely hue,
Perfect teeth and golden hair, gorgeous
Like a youth of sixteen years,
Wearing all the jewel ornaments.
Your right hand grips a kīla of bronze,
Subjugating māras and rākṣasas.
Your left hand holds a kīla of teak,
Granting protection to your devoted sons and daughters,
Around your neck you wear a kīla of iron—
You and the yidam deity are inseparable,
O Dzam Ling Gyen Chok, manifestation of non-duality:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When you choose to go to the 'Land of Phantoms',
The ground on which the blazing pyre is lit
Turns into a lake, the width of an arrow shot,
Where, on a lotus blossom, you appear, cool and sparkling.
Within the lotus, you display your realization
And win the name of Pemajungné, ‘Lotus-born'.
You come in person as a completely realized buddha—
O wondrous nirmāṇakāya, such as you:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!
With your power, dispel the obstacles facing us all!
Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When you shine as the sun over Tibet,
An awe-inspiring guide for any with devotion in their hearts,
You display whatever forms each being needs to be tamed.
High up on the Khala mountain pass in Tsang,
You place the genyen of the dralas under oath.
Down in the valley of Tsawarong,
It was the arrogant genyen of the gods,
Twenty-one of them, you make swear fealty.
In Mangyul, at the temple 'Cloud of Love',
You grant attainments to the four bhikṣus. 3
O supreme Khyépar Pakpé Rigdzin:

Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!

oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
On Palmotang’s plain of glory
You give the twelve tenma goddesses their binding oath.
Up on the Khala pass of Central Tibet,
You bind the white snow goddess Gangkar Shamé under oath.
In the marshlands of Damshö before Mount Lhabüi Nying,
You swear Thangla Yarshu to a solemn vow.
High up, on the peak of Mount Hépori,
You place all the devas and rākṣasas under oath:
And out of all these great gods and demons,
Some offer up the very essence of their life force,
Some are turned into guardians of the teachings,
Others take the pledge to act as your servants.
O mighty Dzutrul Thuchen:

oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When you plant the teachings of the sublime Dharma,
As if hoisting a victory banner,
Samyé is completed spontaneously, with no need to be built,
And the entire vision of the king is fulfilled.
Then, you bore the names of three supreme beings—
One was Padmākara, ‘Lotus-born’,
One was Padmasambhava,
And one was Tsokyé Dorjé, ‘the Lake-born Vajra’.
O Dorjé Drakpo Tsal, now we invoke you by your secret name:
With your compassion, inspire us with your blessing!
With your love, guide us and others along the path!
With your realization, grant us attainments!

Outer obstacles—dispel them externally,
Inner obstacles—dispel them internally,
Secret obstacles—dispel them into space!
In devotion, I pay homage and take refuge in you!
oṃ āh hūṃ vajra guru padma siddhi hūṃ
When you practise at Samyé Chimphu,
You ward off harmful circumstances, and grant attainments.
You set the king and ministers on the path to liberation,
Destroying those teachings of the Bönpos that conjure evil spirits,
And showing the dharmakāya, precious and immaculate.
